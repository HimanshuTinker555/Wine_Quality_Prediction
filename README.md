# Wine_Quality_Prediction
## Introduction
Develop classification model to predict the Quality of the wine. We are going to use the dataset from kaggle.com. we are use four type of machine learning model with 93.43% accuracy score. Random forest classifier perform very well.

Data science concepts used in this project-

* Data loading
* Data Cleaning
* Data Analysis and Visualization
* Outliers Detection and Cleaning
* Feature Engineering
* Machine learning models
* Confusion matrix and Classification report
* GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning
* ROC and AUC Curves

Tools used in this project

* Python
* Numpy and Pandas
* Matplotlib for Data visualization
* Seaborn for plotting graphs
* Sklearn for model building
* Jupyter Notebook

## Steps
We will first build a model using sklearn using wine quality dataset from kaggle.com

*Step#1: Import the required libraries
*Step#2: Load the data
*Step#3: Understand the data
*Step#4: Data Cleaning
        - Check for na values
        - Verify unique values of each column
        - Make sure values are correct
        - Feature Engineering
        - Outlier Detection using Distribution and boxplot
        - Outlier removal using Inter quartile range
*Step#5: Correlation between columns
*Step#6: Train & Test Split
*Step#7: Build Machine Learning Models
*Step#8: Testing the model
*Step#9: ROC and AUC Curve
*Step#10: Building Predictive System
